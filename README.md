# A Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Approach for Stance Detection on FNC-1 Dataset using TF-IDF,  Cosine Similarity, and SVM
Stance prediction is a fundamental task in the domain of automated fake news detection, aiming to determine the contextual relationship between a news headline and its associated article body. In this study, a stance classification model has been developed using the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) dataset, which includes annotated headline-body pairs labelled as agree, disagree, discuss, or unrelated. The proposed methodology integrates both lexical and semantic information by combining traditional vector space models with similarity-based features. Preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming were applied to normalize the textual inputs. A unified Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer was employed to transform both headline and body texts into a shared high-dimensional space, enabling consistent and interpretable feature extraction. Additionally, cosine similarity between headline - body pairs and the count of overlapping stemmed tokens were computed to enhance semantic modelling. These features were concatenated and passed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, trained using a stratified split and optimized via grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed model achieved a test accuracy of 97.62%, a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.87, and an FNC-1 weighted score of 0.9428, demonstrating its efficacy across all stance categories. Visualization of stance distribution and confusion matrix further validated the classifierâ€™s discriminative performance. The results underscore the effectiveness of hybrid feature architectures that integrate lexical representations with semantic alignment measures. This research highlights the practical utility of linear-kernel SVMs in scalable and interpretable stance detection frameworks for misinformation mitigation.
